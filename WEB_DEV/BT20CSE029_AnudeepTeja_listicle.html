                    This the Computer Science Department of VNIT Nagpur.I am a VNIT student and engaged with Computer Science and Engineering specification.
                    As we know presently CSE is the top specification in Btech degree. CSE graduates are in high demand and earn good salaries right after their Btech/BE because everything, from retail to education to food to apparel is technology-oriented.There is a wide variety of reasons for choosing computer science over the other engineering branches like it has many specializations.Because of the high demand for computer science and technology in the industry, B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering courses have grown in popularity, allowing students to work as Systems Analysts, Web Developers, Finance Programmers, Software Engineers, Product Managers, Game Developers, and other roles.

                    This the Chemistry department of VNIT Nagpur.The Chemistry Laboratory conducts fundamental studies of highway materials to understand both failure mechanisms and superior performance. New standard test methods are developed to improve and facilitate the chemical analysis of highway materials and to characterize and quantify new or alternative sustainable materials. The Laboratory also assists with forensic investigations of premature failures of pavements and other highway structures.

                    This the physics department of VNIT Nagpur.Discoveries made in science are done so through the process of experimentation. Physics, which is the study of energy and matter, is no different. Knowledge that furthers the science of physics is gained through following the scientific method, which includes performing experiments to prove a hypothesis. Most often these experiments are performed in a physics laboratory, more commonly called a physics lab. Physics labs are also used by students who learn about the science through demonstration in a physics lab.The design and function of a physics lab has changed throughout the years. With the invention of computers and highly sophisticated computer software, modern physics labs allow scientists to run complicated computer simulations as part of laboratory experiments.
